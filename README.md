# UK-GAAP-Sec-102-MAS
An MAS Architecture that handles different revenue recognition issues with the upcoming Sec 102 changes in UK GAAP, focusing on construction.

This is a prototype of a larger trained project that will likely use Unsloth to use SLMs to handle revenue recognition issues and compose journal entries with reasoning and explanations.



Interview Basic Notes: There are two major contract types: [JCT and NEC] Monthly cost reports are probably more relevant, there are possibly VAT issues as well. The contract may be relevant for mechanisms. Refurbs affect the treatment of VAT status, possibly splits. The contractor is responsible for the sub-contracts unpaid VAT, this could be an issue. Government projects may have special forms and services required, there was one called enviro-something.

There are three things running in series: Monthly evaluations, there is also reporting to the client usually in the style of a report (on program, cashflow, variability, etc), CVR (Cost Value Reconciliation - outlines the job, cost of the work, the value and gives a report of the jobs missing target).

Is there a name of the summary report of BoQ? CSA is a contract sum analysis and has been changed or become more common, it is an analysis of the cost of the job (which is really the BoQ). It would be either stages or elements, perhaps the elements could derive the steps, could be concrete or steel or timberframe or structurally insulated panels. Structures are done out of concrete, plywood, in special fixtures.


You are required to see when general requirements have been changed or not; there are generalized or non-standard standard documents (yes, you read that right), they are semi-standard. There is a certificate of payment that must be issued by QS for when there is an issued application. Payment notice had changed, there is a significant amount of timeline management that is important.
